S3 standard storage: $0.023 / GB / mo
Putatively, 5 clips can take up 2.2 MB
This implies 2327 clips / GB
Estimated clip storage cost: 1/10000 cents per clip


Putative average untrimmed recording size: 3.715 MB
Data transfer into S3: 0
Data transfer out of S3: $0.09 / GB
It takes 276 clip transfers to use up 1 GB bandwidth
One clip transfer costs 3.3/1000 cents

Assume every untrimmed recording is accessed exactly once...
Cost (in cents) of clip creation = 3.3/10000 * unique clips created

In addition, the 3.715 MB of recording costs 1 month of storage = (3.715 / 1024) * 0.023 = 0.0084 cents



Suppose a server creates 50 clips. The creation cost is 50*3.3/10000 cents = $0.0163

The temporary cost to store the 50 original recordings is 50 * 0.0084 cents = 0.42 cents

So the total creation cost is about 0.02 cents

The monthly storage cost is 50/10000 cents



In general, the costs for N clips is
One-time creation: N * (33/100_000 + 84/1_000_000) cents
Monthly storage: N / 10_000 cents

In general one-time creation should be about 4 times the monthly storage cost for N clips.
Even with 100_000 clips, the costs are trivial - 40 cents to create, and 10 cents to maintain per month.
