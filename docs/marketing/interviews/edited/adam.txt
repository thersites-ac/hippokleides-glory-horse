INTERPRETATION:
Adam is a chess player first and Discord user last; he would not participate on the platform if his
preferred chess community were not on it. He does recognize that Discord is a good match for the
qualities that he likes about Chess Dojo, though. He does not use voice much but isn't opposed to
it; he sees it as an opportunity for focused time--a sort of social/hobby deep work. He is also
aware of the comedic potential of a well-timed clip playback, but doesn't see himself as the
audience for this feature. He appreciates bots to help manage the complexity of online societies,
but it is essential that these tools solve a real problem without adding any overhead.
