INTERPRETATION:
Pat is a Discord-as-extended-phone-call user, but he doesn't consider himself representative of the
population. He does not find large public channels worth the effort to engage in. This also limits
his exposure to other features he might enjoy, such as bot services. He finds certain sounds
inherently rewarding, not for the verbal content, but for its acoustic properties. He was the only
person to articulate the potential of a bot as a phonetic reference.
