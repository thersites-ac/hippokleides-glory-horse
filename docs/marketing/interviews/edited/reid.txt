INTERPRETATION:
Reid interestingly seems to separate his text chat and voice chat: Slack for text, Discord for
voice. These both serve essentially the same purpose, namely keeping up with old IRL friends. He is
aware of the rewarding potential of sound clips, but currently does not take advantage of them, and
might have trouble getting started.
