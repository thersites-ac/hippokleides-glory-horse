        - preferred messaging app

    Can you describe a typical voice/video session?
        - call with friends over covid:
            - unlike facetime
            - goes through phases of intense use, then stops and restarts
            - start with DM, video call to say hi, stream something, someone falls asleep, end it
            - 10pm - 4am: these hours are unique to Discord

- Bots
    Tell me about any bots you use.
        - music bots for festivals
            - fredboat, groovy, jockeymusic
        - moderation bots
    What do you like about the bots you use? 
        - throwing a bot off with commands is fun
            - exploring random commands, trying hidden ones
            - joke banning
        - "like having a little AI friend"
    If you don't use any bots, why?
    Tell me about the easiest-to-use bot you've encountered.
        - long list of commands are hard to use
        - 3rd party bots can be unreliable
        - groovy was good for a time
            - lots of functions, but complexity is hidden
    Which servers need a bot?

- Soundboards
    Where have you encountered soundboards?
        - haven't used or encountered
    What kinds of clips belong in a soundboard?
    How should a soundboard's controls feel?

- Etc.
    How did you decide to add a bot to a server? OR
    How do you discover new mobile apps to install? OR
    Tell me about a time you decided to install a browser extension.

- Finish on high note
    If you could capture any audio you hear at will, where would you replay it?
        - sound of George Clinton's vocals at electronicon 3 playing Livin' Loose: replay everywhere, anywhere
            - "a lot of spectral density - it hugs my eardrums"
            - mellow, nice

- About yesfest:
    - started after she was rejected from a festival, after being told she could perform
    - safe space to present works
    - streams like a radio show
    - queues music into the bot
    - has an application for upcoming festival (used to be a free-for-all)
        - criteria: "music makes me smile", or musical diversity
    - ~2.5 years: originally yearly; now every 6 mo
    - goal is to create a community through the server
    - longer-term goal would be to make festival IRL
    - online music festivals:
        - picked up over pandemic, but existed before
        - cross-application: minecraft & discord, telegram, etc.
        - losing a bit of steam post-pandemic
        - live shows are still a preference
