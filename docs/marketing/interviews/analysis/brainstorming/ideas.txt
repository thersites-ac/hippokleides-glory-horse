How might I make capturing a clip effortless?

In-Discord UI
Pre-captured clips
Voice command: "Hippo, clip X"
Instantaneous responsiveness
Hippo offers to clip users after audio cues
No need to specify a user; get all audio displayed in the clip UI
Clip autonaming
Clips don't need names
Brain controls
Constantly-available UI (always showing the most up-to-date 30s)


What if Hippo was voice-activated?

"Hippo, clip X"
"Hippo, clip that"
UI to fix up/tune Hippo's work
"Hippo, play X"
Auto-clip after laughter or raucous moment
autoplay clips at correct detected moments via
    - keywords
    - mood/sentiment
    - current speaker
    - speaker causing a reaction

(Good for: Erin)


What if clips sounded crisper after being saved/created?
    
Clip bad moments
Clip more
Modify clips to slightly change what users said
Volume controls
Ambiance controls

(Good for: Brandon, Jeff)


What if you could autotune clips or set them to music?

Preloaded library of tunes
Server runner can add tunes to Hippo for music/autotune
extract audio from streaming game and associate with clip
compose songs of multiple users

(Good for: Brandon, Jeff?)


What if users didn't have to identify the right clip to play back?

voice activation
tagged clips
    - message to pick a random clip with a tag
    - sentiment tags: Hippo picks right clip for perceived mood
    - autogenerated tags based on mood/content of clip

(Good for: all)


What if Hippo could immitate voices?

create conversations
change speaker of a statement
clip in voice of someone not in the server
mockery bot
video game character voices
...what if Hippo could speak in voice chat?

(Good for: Jeff)
